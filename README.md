# Advanced Programming Techniques - Assignment 1

This project implements a program to convert numbers from one numeral system to another, as described in `Programming-Assignment-1.pdf`.

## Project Description
This project is part of the "Advanced Programming Techniques" course and focuses on implementing various numeral system conversions.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler:** Ensure `g++` is installed.
- **Python 3:** Required for running the test scripts.

## Instructions

### 1. Compile the Program
Run the following command to compile the program:
```bash
g++ -o program1 program1.cc
```

### 2. Run the Program
Execute the program using:
```bash
./program1
```

### 3. Validate the Implementation
Use the provided test scripts to verify correctness:
```bash
python3 instructor_tests1.py [test_case_number]
python3 instructor_tests2.py [test_case_number]
```

## Test Results

All test cases passed successfully:
- `instructor_tests1.py`: ✅
- `instructor_tests2.py`: ✅

## Files Included

- **Numeration-Systems.pdf**: Documentation explaining the numeration systems used in the project.
- **Programming-Assignment-1.pdf**: Assignment instructions and problem statement.
- **program1.cc**: Source code for the program.
- **instructor_tests1.py**: Python script containing test cases for numeration system conversions.
- **instructor_tests2.py**: Additional test cases provided for testing advanced scenarios.
- **test_to_decimal.py**: Core implementation for converting numeration systems to decimal.
